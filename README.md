# stack_data_analysis

Here I have used numpy, pandas and matplotlib to perform data analytic functions after taking data from .csv and .xlsx files and then write a desired .csv/.xlsx
I have used jupyter notebook to compile the codes as it provides a better visualization schematics and since we can run snippets of code line by line.
My data set here is the annual Stackoverflow developer survey of 2019 which is in the format .csv
the tasks i have performed here:
$ create data frame, select row/column/cell, add and del entries
$ Filtering: using conditionals to filter rows and columns
$ Sorting data 
$ Grouping and aggregating: analysis and extrapolation of data
$ Cleaning data: casting datatypes and handling missing values

Then on the other file 'Sublime_graph' I have used the .csv and .xlsx generated from the stack_analysis.ipyb to plot and map data in the form of graphs of different kinds
these tasks I have performed in Sublime text3 using matplotlib
1.bar.py
2.pie.py
